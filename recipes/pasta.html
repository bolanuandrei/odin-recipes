        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>250g chargrilled Mediterranean veg</li>
            <li>400gr chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp small cappers</li>
            <li>350gr rigatoni</li>
            <li>basil leaves</li>
            <li>parmesan</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
             <li>Heat the oil in a large pan and cook the onion for 8-10 mins until starting to caramelise (or for longer if you have time â€“ the sweeter the better). Add the garlic for the final 2 mins of cooking time.</li>
             <li>Tip in the mixed veg, tomatoes, capers and raisins. Season well and simmer, uncovered, for 10 mins, or until you have a rich sauce.</li>
             <li>Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the kettleful of water into a large pan with a little salt and bring back to the boil. Add the pasta and cook until tender with a little bite, then drain, reserving some of the pasta water. Tip the pasta into the sauce, adding a splash of pasta water if it needs loosening. Scatter with the basil leaves and parmesan, if you like, and serve straight from the pan</li>
         </ol>
